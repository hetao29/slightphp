This is a standalone PHP extension


BUILDING ON UNIX etc.
=====================

To compile your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps:

1.  $ ./phpize
2.  $ ./configure [--enable--SlightPHP] 
3.  $ make
4.  $ make test
5.  $ [sudo] make install



BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

The extension provides the VisualStudio V6 project file 

  SlightPHP.dsp
To compile the extension you open this file using VisualStudio,
select the apropriate configuration for your installation
(either "Release_TS" or "Debug_TS") and create "php_SlightPHP.dll"

After successfull compilation you have to copy the newly
created "SlightPHP.dll" to the PHP
extension directory (default: C:\PHP\extensions).


TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="SlightPHP.[so|dll]"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("SlightPHP.[so|dll]");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded("SlightPHP"))
    echo "SlightPHP loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
